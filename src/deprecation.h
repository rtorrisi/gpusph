 * Macros to mark functions as deprecated
 */

#ifndef _DEPRECATION_H
#define _DEPRECATION_H

// Since GPUSPH 3.0 we will try to preserve API between minor version
// of the software, in the sense that a problem written for GPUSPH M.0
// should be expected to also compile and run on GPUSPH M.x, up to the
// next major release.
// To this end, when a new (better) API is offered for some features,
// it should be carried side-by-side with the older, deprecated one.
// All the user-visible functions and variables of the deprecated API
// should still be offered, marked with the DEPRECRATED attribute,
// so that the user will know at compile time that a new API is being
// offered and that they should migrate.
// Deprecated functions and class methods should also print a message
// on stderr on (first) usage, so that even on execution the user
// is reminded to upgrade to the new API.

#ifdef _MSC_VER
#define DEPRECATED
#define DEPRECATED_MSG(str)
#else
/* Mark a function deprecated */
#define DEPRECATED __attribute__((deprecated))

/* Mark a function deprecated, explaining what to do instead,
 */

#define DEPRECATED_MSG(str) __attribute__((deprecated(str)))
#endif

/* For the functions that provide compatibility between the deprecated
 * and new APIs, we want to avoid getting deprecation warnings,
 * since they are only for (all the) other uses of the deprecated APIs.
 * To achieve this, we would wrap the compatibility code in this way:

#pragma GCC diagnostic push
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wdeprecated-declarations"
compatibility_code(calling, deprecated, functions);
and_or_assigning_to = obsolete_variables;
#pragma GCC diagnostic pop

 * which is only supported fully since GCC 4.6, and partially since 4.2.
 *
 * To have cleaner compiles with older versions of GCC (yes, some users have
 * reported using versions older than 4.2 (!)), we wrap these diagnostic
 * functions in a macro that does nothing before GCC 4.6, which we
 * use as cut-off for properly supported clean compilation.
 *
 * See also
 * http://dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/SuppressingGCCWarnings.html
 * for a more complete solution.
